# PHP ORM/Router

Lightweight PHP URL Router and ORM Framework

## Getting Started

* Make sure your web server is setup to route all URLs through `/index.php`.
* Fill out a `or-config.php` file based on `or-config-example.php`.
* Define your models in the `models/` folder, based on the examples in `examples/models/`.
* Define your controller in the `controllers/` folder, based on the examples in `examples/contractors/`.
  You can name it whatever you want, the application will automatically find it and include it.
